# Guidance for the URL Shortener Coding Test

Welcome! In this coding test, you will design and implement a simplified version of a URL shortener service, similar to services like bit.ly or tinyurl.com. The goal is to evaluate your problem-solving skills, coding ability, system design thinking, and understanding of key concepts such as hashing, encoding, data storage, and API design.

## Key Requirements to Consider

### Core Functionality:

- Given a long URL, generate a unique shortened URL.
- Given a shortened URL, redirect or retrieve the original long URL.

### Uniqueness and Collision Handling:

- Ensure that each shortened URL is unique.
- Handle potential collisions if your encoding or hashing method produces duplicates.

### Scalability and Efficiency:

- Consider how your design would scale with millions of URLs.
- Think about efficient storage and retrieval.

### API Design:

- Design simple APIs or functions for:
  - Creating a short URL from a long URL.
  - Retrieving the original URL from a short URL.

### Data Storage:

- Decide on a data structure or database for storing URL mappings.
- Discuss trade-offs between in-memory storage, databases, or key-value stores.

### Additional Features (Optional):

- Expiration of URLs.
- Analytics (click counts).
- Custom aliases.

## Suggested Approach

1. **Step 1**: Clarify requirements and assumptions (e.g., URL format, length constraints).
2. **Step 2**: Choose an encoding strategy (e.g., base62 encoding of an auto-increment ID, hashing).
3. **Step 3**: Design the data model to store URL mappings.
4. **Step 4**: Implement core functions for shortening and retrieving URLs.
5. **Step 5**: Write test cases to validate correctness.
6. **Step 6**: Discuss how to extend or improve your solution.

## Tips

- Focus on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Explain your thought process as you go.
- Handle edge cases gracefully.
- If time permits, discuss system design considerations.
