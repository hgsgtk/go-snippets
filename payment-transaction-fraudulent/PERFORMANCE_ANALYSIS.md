# Performance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The current brute force implementation shows significant performance degradation as dataset size increases, particularly in worst-case scenarios. The O(n²) time complexity becomes a bottleneck for large datasets.

## Benchmark Results

### 1,000 Transactions Performance

| Scenario | Time | Transactions/sec | Memory | Allocations |
|----------|------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Normal Case** | 1.88ms | 532,000 | 876KB | 3,478 |
| **Worst Case** | 18.11ms | 55,000 | 122MB | 12,010 |
| **Best Case** | 2.44ms | 410,000 | 179KB | 2,003 |

### Scalability Analysis

| Dataset Size | Time | Transactions/sec | Memory Usage | Performance Trend |
|--------------|------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 100 | 55µs | 1,800,000 | 90KB | Excellent |
| 500 | 594µs | 840,000 | 429KB | Good |
| 1,000 | 1.83ms | 546,000 | 845KB | Acceptable |
| 2,000 | 7.53ms | 266,000 | 1.7MB | Poor |
| 5,000 | 44ms | 114,000 | 4.2MB | Very Poor |

## Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. **O(n²) Time Complexity**
- Each transaction scans through all other transactions
- Performance degrades quadratically with dataset size
- Worst case: All transactions for same person (100% fraudulent rate)

### 2. **Memory Allocation Overhead**
- High number of allocations per operation
- Memory usage grows linearly with dataset size
- Worst case scenario uses 122MB for 1,000 transactions

### 3. **String Parsing Overhead**
- Each transaction requires string parsing
- Multiple allocations for string operations
- Could be optimized with pre-allocated buffers

## Performance Characteristics

### **Normal Case (Mixed Data)**
- **1,000 transactions**: ~532,000 transactions/second
- **Memory efficiency**: ~876 bytes per transaction
- **Fraud detection rate**: ~58% (realistic scenario)

### **Worst Case (All Same Person)**
- **1,000 transactions**: ~55,000 transactions/second
- **Memory efficiency**: ~122KB per transaction
- **Fraud detection rate**: 100% (all flagged as fraudulent)
- **Performance impact**: 10x slower than normal case

### **Best Case (Unique Persons)**
- **1,000 transactions**: ~410,000 transactions/second
- **Memory efficiency**: ~179 bytes per transaction
- **Fraud detection rate**: 0% (no fraudulent transactions)

## Performance Recommendations

### **Immediate Optimizations (Low Effort)**

1. **Pre-allocate slices**
   ```go
   sameName := make([]Transaction, 0, len(allTransactions)/10)
   ```

2. **Use string builder for parsing**
   ```go
   var sb strings.Builder
   ```

3. **Avoid repeated string operations**
   - Cache parsed transactions
   - Reuse transaction objects

### **Algorithm Improvements (Medium Effort)**

1. **Hash Map Approach (Approach 3)**
   - Expected improvement: 10-100x faster
   - Memory usage: Similar to current
   - Complexity: Medium

2. **Pre-sorting by Name (Approach 2)**
   - Expected improvement: 5-10x faster
   - Memory usage: 2x current
   - Complexity: Low

### **Production Optimizations (High Effort)**

1. **Database-like Indexing (Approach 6)**
   - Expected improvement: 100-1000x faster
   - Memory usage: 3-5x current
   - Complexity: High

2. **Sliding Window with Circular Buffer (Approach 5)**
   - Expected improvement: 50-200x faster
   - Memory usage: Fixed (regardless of dataset size)
   - Complexity: High

## Performance Thresholds

### **Acceptable Performance**
- **< 1,000 transactions**: Current implementation is acceptable
- **1,000-5,000 transactions**: Consider Approach 2 (Pre-sorting)
- **> 5,000 transactions**: Implement Approach 3 (Hash Map)

### **Real-time Processing Requirements**
- **< 100 transactions/second**: Current implementation works
- **100-1,000 transactions/second**: Implement Approach 3
- **> 1,000 transactions/second**: Implement Approach 6

## Memory Usage Analysis

### **Current Memory Profile**
- **Normal case**: ~876 bytes per transaction
- **Worst case**: ~122KB per transaction (140x increase)
- **Best case**: ~179 bytes per transaction

### **Memory Optimization Opportunities**
1. **Reduce string allocations**: Use byte slices instead of strings
2. **Pool transaction objects**: Reuse struct instances
3. **Compact data structures**: Use smaller data types where possible

## Conclusion

The current brute force implementation is suitable for:
- **Small datasets** (< 1,000 transactions)
- **Prototyping and development**
- **Educational purposes**

For production use with larger datasets, consider implementing:
1. **Approach 2 (Pre-sorting)** for 1,000-10,000 transactions
2. **Approach 3 (Hash Map)** for 10,000+ transactions
3. **Approach 6 (Indexing)** for 100,000+ transactions

The performance analysis shows that the current implementation becomes a bottleneck at around 1,000 transactions, with the worst-case scenario being particularly problematic due to the O(n²) complexity.
